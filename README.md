# Readable project

In the Readable project you will find a simple post application, which you can submit a post or comments for other posts, you also scores posts and comments.

The project has three pre-defined categories: React, Redux and Udacity, and all posts should be categorized into one of then.

The main page shows all posts, which can be sorted by score (likes / dislikes) or submission date.

By default, posts are organized by punctuation.

Initially, posts from all three categories are displayed: React, Redux and Udacity, but you can filter it.

For the purpose of editing and deleting posts and comments, we have created 4 users (ThingOne, ThingTwo, Tyler and Adan), and you can choose one of these
options. Only the owner of the post or comment can edit or delete.

If you click on "View more", it will show a specific post page, where the post will be displayed. All the posts's comments will be displayed as well.

In this page you can also add comments, you can like or dislike the post and comments as well.

The comments will be sorted by score.

The main goal of this project was the functionality, so the visual wasn't very well developed.
